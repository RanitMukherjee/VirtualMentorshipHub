## Development

### Requirements

You'll need a few globals, namely 'npm' or 'yarn' -- both a node package managers, we use Yarn but
you're free to use either! However, you'll use NPM to install Yarn (of course..)

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) (version > 8.2 for best results)
- Postgres (version > 9.5; we recommend using the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)/[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) -- when developing, monitor filesystem for changes

The web app was bootstrapped using [create-react-app], but you won't need that to run it---only
a recent version of Node.

### Get started

**Web** - go to the `/app` directory and run `yarn start`<br/>
**Server** - go to `/server` and run `yarn dev`
